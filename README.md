# Power-Bi-Project
In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize company sales data across various dimensions, with a focus on regional performance, customer segmentation, and product profitability. Key tasks and insights include:

Sales Overview:

Tracked total sales ($9.74M) against a target of $7M using KPI cards.

Visualized sales growth over time through a line chart spanning years 2020 to 2022.

Regional Breakdown:

Built bar charts to compare total sales by continent (Australia, Europe, North America), highlighting North America as the top contributor.

Used a pie chart to break down country-level performance, showing the U.S. leading with over 80% of sales.

Product Profitability:

Analyzed margin % by product category (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing) to identify the most profitable segments.

Filtered views with slicers for Year and Continent to enable interactive analysis.

Monthly Sales Trend:

Integrated an area chart to track total sales by month, illustrating consistent growth with a peak in December.

Data Model:

Connected multiple tables (Customer, Product, Sales, Order Date, Sales Territory) using one-to-many relationships based on keys like Customer Key and Product Key.

Implemented calculated measures like Line Total Sales, Line Margin %, Target, and Order Quantity using DAX.

Customer Insights:

Explored customer data including demographics (e.g., yearly income, marital status, car ownership), providing the potential for customer segmentation and personalization.
